## used in a sentence
If someone or something is just not as good enough when compared to another, it is said that it canâ€™t hold a candle to the far superior, much better version. So â€“ as a hypothetical example â€“ every other history magazine canâ€™t hold a candle toÂ _History Revealed_.

## Origin
It doesnâ€™t take much to illuminate the origins of the phrase. The light of a single candle will do. Before electric lights, craftsmen would employ someone as a second pair of hands, chiefly to hold candles close enough so they could see what they were doing.

As this was not a skilled job â€“ the candle-holding apprentices were usually children â€“ it would have been a grievous **insult** for trainee craftsmen to be told **they werenâ€™t good enough even to hold the candle**, let alone do the expert, highly-trained work of the actual craftsmen.
