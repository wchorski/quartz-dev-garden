> The Latin maxim ignoramus et ignorabimus, meaning *"we do not know and will not know"*, stood for a position on the limits of scientific knowledge, in the thought of the nineteenth century. It was given credibility by Emil du Bois-Reymond, a German physiologist, in his Ãœber die Grenzen des Naturerkennens ("On the limits of our understanding of nature") of 1872.
