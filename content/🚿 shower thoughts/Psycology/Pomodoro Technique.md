> The **Pomodoro Technique** is a [time management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management "Time management") method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#cite_note-Cirillo-1) It uses a [kitchen timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_timer "Kitchen timer") to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a _pomodoro_, from the [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") word for [tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique#cite_note-3)

A study technique that breaks work into smaller sprints broken up by short breaks.

I would have included this in my [FL Studio Tips](📁music/FL%20Studio%20Tips/FL%20Studio%20Tips.md) except it can be applied to anything. I've been using the built in stop timer on my phone or pc to do this, but I'm thinking of getting a egg timer just for the aesthetic
