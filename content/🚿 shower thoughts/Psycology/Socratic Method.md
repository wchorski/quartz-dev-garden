The Socratic method is named afterÂ [Greek philosopher Socrates](https://www.thoughtco.com/profile-of-socrates-121053)Â who taught students by asking question after question. Socrates sought to expose contradictions in the studentsâ€™ thoughts and ideas to then guide them to solid, tenable conclusions. The method is still popular in legal classrooms today.
