In response to [The Secret Online Piracy Club You've Never Heard Of - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1aqZT7jbo8) video,  It seems that modern media streaming and piracy battle over 3 points  

1. Ownership
2. Price 
3. Archival and Delivery of media
  
## Ownership
For the streaming platforms, ownership is equally related to price. They keep costs down at the expense of client ownership. Would you pay more a month to have DRM free, downloadable content?

## Price
Would you pay a $50 subscription fee to Netflix's library if that came with DRM free downloadable content? I'd say probably not because that doesn't fit in the budget of most households. But the thing to remember is, "would you have spent $50 a month in buying physical media that month?". 

## Archival and Delivery
Archival for a streaming service doesn't hold a candle to torrent networks. The vast computing power and storage space a community can hold and deliver will always win.

## Conclusion
The line is blurred. I see torrenting as more of an IT exercise as apposed to a means to a media end. The benefits in each platform are clear, so really it's up to the user on which one benefits them the most (monetarily and/or morally) 

My real hope is that (using music as an example) artists directly host their music on their personal websites, and we the consumers can collect said music. Now I know platforms like


## Side Notes
One issue that didn't fit in the above categories is client storage hardware. A huge advantage of streaming platforms is just that, **Streaming**. Client's don't have to worry about upgrading their local storage capacities. I think this is a double edge sword because storage is so cheap these days that taking the time to learn how to plug in a new HDD is worth the effort and will be cheaper in the long run.
