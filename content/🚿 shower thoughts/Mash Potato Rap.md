Yo

I'm here to talk about mash potatoes The best food on the planet, no doubt It's creamy, it's smooth, it's got flavor I could eat it every day, no matter the weather

I love the way it feels on my tongue The way it melts in my mouth, so scrumptious I could eat it with a spoon, or a fork, or my hands I don't care, I just want to eat it, all the lands

I love mash potatoes with gravy, or butter, or cheese I love it plain, or with chicken, or beef I love it with anything, really It's just so damn good, I can't deny

So if you're ever feeling down Just remember, there's always mash potatoes They'll make you feel better, I guarantee So go out and get some, you won't regret it

Peace out
