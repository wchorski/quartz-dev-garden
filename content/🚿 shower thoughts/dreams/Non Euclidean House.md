House i ran to to be safe. Kinda shitty up keep. find some hidden passage. leads to a few twisting rooms

some rooms booby trapped. some lead to completely bigger way cool arcade / mall. spacing is wildly impossible. finding out slowly something is trying to trap us here. 

trying to get out leads to new or unfamiliar backtracking. there was a lot of stairs down and then one stairs up that looked infinite. there was a long chase moving and getting out, bumped into others that were also trying to get out for long time.

got onto car and ran away.
