**Riddle:**Â There are two guards and two doors, one door is the door that has an exit, the other is a trap. You can only ask one question to figure out the correct path to safety 

- One guard is a liar and lies all the time, the other is honest and is always truthful, 
- They look **identical** so there is no way to tell the difference between the liar and truthful guard. 
- The guards cannot talk, only point to which path that answers your question. 
- You have one question to ask that only one guard can answer to guarantee which door is the exit. What is the question?

> [!answer]-  **The Answer**
> "You ask either guard what your "brother" (the other guard) would say the door is." the liar would lie and point to the wrong door, and the trustworthy one would tell the truth of what the liar would say and point at the wrong door. So you would go towards the opposite door, towards the exit.
