> [!quote]  This is an ancient form of Chinese torture that was preserved in iconic black and white photographs. This form of torture, sometimes known as slow slicing, has different meanings depending on the context. Susan Sontag and Georges Bataille were interested in this form of torture due to the relationship between pain and ecstasy, but many people in business and other industries refer to this type of torture when speaking of creeping normalcy. Creeping normalcy is the idea that slow change is not perceived as being as negative as one large change and that large institutional shifts may occur invisibly in this way. One final meaning of death by a thousand cuts is the literal sense that one small cut may not be harmful, but a thousand small cuts will kill a person.
