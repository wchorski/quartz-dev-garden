Â Danish philosopher Piet Hein - "Grooks":

> Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,
> and you're hampered by not having any,
> the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
> is simply by spinning a penny.
> No -- not so that chance shall decide the affair
> while you're passively standing there moping;
> but the moment the penny is up in the air,
> you suddenly know what you're hoping.
