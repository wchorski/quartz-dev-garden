TheÂ **Venturi effect**Â is the reduction inÂ [fluid pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_pressure "Fluid pressure")Â that results when a fluid flows through a constricted section (or choke) of a pipe. The Venturi effect is named after its discoverer, the 18th-century ItalianÂ [physicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist "Physicist")Â [Giovanni Battista Venturi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Venturi "Giovanni Battista Venturi").
