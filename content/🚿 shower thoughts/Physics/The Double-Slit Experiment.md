Ever hear of the double-slit experiment? Itâ€™s one of the most bizarre experiments in modernÂ [physics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a40898392/quantum-physics-consciousness/), and cuts to the heart of the weirdness of quantum mechanics. Basically, waves that pass through two narrow, parallel slits will form an interference pattern on a screen. This is true for all waves, whether theyâ€™re light waves,Â [water waves](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a40809688/indoor-ocean-tests-seagoing-vessels/), or sound waves

First you must understand what refraction is

## Diffraction
Diffraction is the change in direction of waves as they encounter obstacles or apertures. Diffraction is most noticable if the wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the obstacle or aperture. If the wave length is much smaller than the obstacle or aperture, diffraction is difficult to detect. Because of diffraction of sound waves you can easily hear around corners and walls, and through open windows and doors, even though you are not in line with the sound source.
