I'm looking for a VPN that takes the crypto currency Monero (XMR)

## Pricing
comparing pricing and knowing the resources it takes to host, something below **$3 a month** seems to be the most honest cost

I went with Torguard paying **$49.99** for 24 months ($2.83 / month) 
## Pay with Crypto
A lot of the VPN vendors don't take payment directly, they want payment from crypto apps
actually I was very backwards. These 'coinpayments', 'coingate', etc are services that are payment gates for customers that the vpn provider host. When going to pay, it will generate a wallet to send the funds directly
