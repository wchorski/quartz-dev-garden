## AI automated Social Media Account

I've seen developers create automated social media accounts that put up 'inspirational' or 'life lesson' quotes over some sort of looping background. I wanted to take this in a sort of parody direction with 
- crazy sounding 'quotes' 
- 'life lessons' that make no sense
- statements / facts that trail off before any resolution. possibly sparking random discussions
