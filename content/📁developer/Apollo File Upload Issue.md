Thank You! I'm gonna follow it up with another question, but it relates to NextJS / Apollo (so apologies on relevancy). 

this [official example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-apollo/lib/apolloClient.js) shows how to set up **Apollo** with **NextJS**. Yet I'm still confused 

## I've Tried
- [nextjs cookies server side](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware#using-cookies)
- [nextjs frontend cookies]()
- [apollos docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/networking/authentication/#header) say to use local storage which I tried, but that doesn't make sense as the `window` object isn't available yet
- [apollo file upload](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/file-uploads/)
