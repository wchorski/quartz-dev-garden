You've probably set the parent and child element `border-radius` to the same value expecting them to line up, but it's the padding that throws the angle of the curve off

The inner radius needs to equal the outer radius - padding

```scss
.parent{
	padding: 1.25rem;
	border-radius: 3rem;
}

.child{
	border-radius: 1.75rem;
}
```
