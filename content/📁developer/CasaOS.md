I tried [CasaOS - A simple, easy-to-use, elegant open-source personal cloud system](https://casaos.io/) as a turn key solution to run a handful of self hosted apps located in a family member's network. 

My thoughts to follow...

## My Thoughts
Initially, it has a pretty UI and all the basic needs I'd want in a n00b friendly [Home Lab 🏠](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Home%20Lab%20🏠.md). The `App Store` has some essential apps, but is a bit lacking. Luckily all **CasaOS** is is a [Docker](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Docker.md) wrapper (similar to [portainer](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/portainer.md)). 

Speaking of which, it automatically creates a shortcut when I go spin up a container, even from the command line.   

I like how it's not actually an **Operating System** but an app installed onto a vanilla [[Debian]] distro. That way I can install other apps and tools in tandem.
