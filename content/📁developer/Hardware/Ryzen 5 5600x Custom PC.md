## future silent build

I use open headphones and am also super sensible to loud PCs. My latest build has full PWM 140mm SilentWings 3 and a DarkRock 4 cooler, the loudest part is now the GPU and backup HDD. But the best part IMO is my Seasonic fanless titanium PSU, that thing is a fucking beast. The pump noise on AIO was exactly what I was worried about and it seems like I made the right choice in the end. Thanks for this!
