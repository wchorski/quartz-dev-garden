> A fast and feature-rich implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812) LEDs or also SPI based chipsets like the WS2801 and APA102!

[Install WLED](https://install.wled.me/) for wireless control of LEDs over wifi. 

> [!warn] I had trouble during install. Something about "hold reset button try again". I just ended up using a different windows machine and then things worked out... maybe I could have tried a different browser? Idk.
