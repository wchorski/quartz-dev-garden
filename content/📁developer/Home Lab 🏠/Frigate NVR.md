A complete CCTV system that is integrated into [Home Assistant](Home%20Assistant.md), This was impart inspired by the lack luster results from [[motion eye]] with it's integrated Object Detection

## installation
I run [Home Assistant](Home%20Assistant.md) on a [Raspberry Pi 4 4gb](Pi4.md). Looking at it's current resource usage,

- 20% CPU
- 42% (2 / 4 gb) RAM

I wanted to see how'd it would handle a couple camera feeds with **Frigate**


## Camera Config
check the `frigate.yaml`

```yaml
mqtt:
	# same IP as HAOS. Using Mosquitto add-on
  host: 192.168.0.0 
  # I set a user up as a basic HA user with login
  user: USERNAME
  password: PASSWORD
cameras:
	# Tapo Camera
  foyer: 
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
        - path: rtsp://USERNAME:PASSWORD@cam-1.lan/stream2
          roles:
            - rtmp
            - record
            - detect
    detect:
      width: 1280
      height: 720
    record:
      enabled: True
      retain:
        days: 0
        mode: all
    
	# USB Camera
  livingroom:
    ffmpeg:
      inputs:
      - path: /dev/video0
        roles:
          - rtmp
          - detect
          - record
      input_args: -f video4linux2 -avoid_negative_ts make_zero -fflags +genpts+discardcorrupt -use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1
    detect:
      width: 640
      height: 480
      
database:
  path: /config/frigate.db
  
```


## First Impressions
setting up my cheap [Tapo C200](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-c200/) camera via RTSP, and USB [PlayStation Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye) camera was fairly strait forward

## Home Assistant Notifications
Here is a premade automation blueprint  by [hunterjm)](https://gist.github.com/hunterjm)- [Frigate Notification Blueprint (github.com)](https://gist.github.com/hunterjm/23c1588a9f2b8b9c2a62ffc364e17f8c)

## Troubleshooting 

```shell
frigate.comms.mqtt             ERROR   : Unable to publish to stats: client is not connected
```

I never set up a MQTT server so I just installed the [mosquitto)](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md) addon available inside of Home Assistant.

## Docker Container

For those who installed [Home Assistant](üìÅdeveloper/Home%20Lab%20üè†/Home%20Assistant.md) Containered version, **Frigate** must be installed like so

### compose.yml
```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  frigate:
    container_name: frigate
    privileged: true # this may not be necessary for all setups
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: ghcr.io/blakeblackshear/frigate:stable
    shm_size: "64mb" # update for your cameras based on calculation above
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb # passes the USB Coral, needs to be modified for other versions
      - /dev/apex_0:/dev/apex_0 # passes a PCIe Coral, follow driver instructions here https://coral.ai/docs/m2/get-started/#2a-on-linux
      - /dev/dri/renderD128 # for intel hwaccel, needs to be updated for your hardware
    volumes:
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - ./config.yml:/config/config.yml
      - ./storage:/media/frigate
      - type: tmpfs # Optional: 1GB of memory, reduces SSD/SD Card wear
        target: /tmp/cache
        tmpfs:
          size: 1000000000
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
      - "8554:8554" # RTSP feeds
      - "8555:8555/tcp" # WebRTC over tcp
      - "8555:8555/udp" # WebRTC over udp
    environment:
      FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD: "password"
```

### MQTT Broker

follow the [Mosquitto MQTT Broker](üìÅdeveloper/Home%20Lab%20üè†/Mosquitto%20MQTT%20Broker.md) article if you need to setup a stand alone MQTT broker
