This is my chain of programs that help me backup and store data whether it's local clone, version controlled, and or remote sight backups

- [FreeFileSync](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/FreeFileSync.md)
	- user friendly GUI
	- clones files 1 to 1. Great for parodying data onto a duplicate machine
- [Duplicati](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Duplicati.md)
	- version control
	- auto deletion of older data
	- user friendly GUI
	- automated backups via the app
- [rsync](📁developer/Linux/rsync.md)
	- command line
	- automated backups over SSH
	- great for remote site backups
