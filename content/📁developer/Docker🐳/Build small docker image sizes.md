I was building a [NextJS](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/NextJS.md) image with [Docker](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Docker.md) and ended up with over **6gb** file sizes.

## Bad

my initial,  bloated `Dockerfile` looked like this

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN yarn install

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["yarn", "start"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

### Better

use `alpine` versions
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN yarn install

ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV PORT 3000

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["yarn", "start"]

```

### Multi Stage Build

multi stage builds can share files and reduce duplication during build process
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY yarn.lock .
COPY package.json .
RUN yarn
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

FROM node:18-alpine as runner
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .
COPY --from=builder /app/yarn.lock .

RUN yarn --production
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js .
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["yarn", "start"]

```

### BEST
```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY yarn.lock .
COPY package.json .
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

FROM node:18-alpine as runner
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .
COPY --from=builder /app/yarn.lock .

COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js .
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["yarn", "start"]

```


### Standalone
In your `next.config.js` file, enable the standalone output
```js
experimental: {  
	outputStandalone: true,  
},
```

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app

COPY yarn.lock .
COPY package.json .
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

FROM node:18-alpine as runner
WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /app/package.json .
COPY --from=builder /app/yarn.lock .

COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js .
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

```
