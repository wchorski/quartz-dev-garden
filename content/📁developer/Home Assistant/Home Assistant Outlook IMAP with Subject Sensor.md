Integrating a Outlook IMAP sensor with [Home Assistant](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Home%20Assistant.md) was a bit convoluted. So here is a step by step of my setup.

## Add the integration
I assume you know how to add a new Integration already. Search for "IMAP". fill in the details as such

- Server: `outlook.office365.com`
- Port: `993`
- Username: Your full email address
- Password: Your password
- Charset: `US-ASCII`
- Folder: keep as 'INBOX' if you want to check everything. In my case I'm using it to track deliveries, so I'm only checking a folder I created called 'deliveries'
- IMAP search: 'UnSeen UnDeleted'. I assume this will be what most people want.

## Subject Sensor
This newly created sensor is essentially an **integer** that tracks how many 'UnSeen UnDeleted' are in the 'deliveries' folder. Any time I check the email and 'read' it, this number will tick back down to `0`. But How do we get more data from the sensor like **Subject**. **Message Body**, **Sender Email Address**, etc? There is a way to configure **Templates** in the 'Helpers' tab, but any time I have to do more conditional stuff, editing the `configuration.yaml` is just easier.

`configuration.yaml`
```yml
template: 
	- trigger:
	    - platform: event
	      event_type: "imap_content"
	      id: "custom_event"
	  sensor:
	    - name: "Last Delivered Package"
	      state: >
	        {{ trigger.event.data["subject"] }}
```

## Conditional Card
And for the final knot to tie this together. A conditional card that pops up on the dashboard only if the 'deliveries' folder has 1 or more unread email

```yml
type: conditional
conditions:
  - condition: numeric_state
    entity: sensor.imap_wc_deliveries_outlook_com
    above: 0
card:
  type: vertical-stack
  cards:
    - type: entities
      entities:
        - entity: sensor.last_delivered_package
        - entity: sensor.imap_wc_deliveries_outlook_com
      state_color: false
      header:
        type: picture
        image: https://clipground.com/images/parcel-png-9.png
        tap_action:
          action: none
        hold_action:
          action: none

```

Just for fun, I've even added a header image to make it super obvious
