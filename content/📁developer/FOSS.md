[Free and open-source software - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)

> **Free and open-source software** (**FOSS**) is a term used to refer to groups of software consisting of both [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") and [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software"),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#cite_note-3) where anyone is [freely licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license "Open-source license") to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code") is publicly available so that people are encouraged to improve the design of the software.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#cite_note-:1-4) This is in contrast to [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software "Proprietary software"), where the software is under restrictive [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") or [licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license "Software license") and the source code is hidden from the users.
