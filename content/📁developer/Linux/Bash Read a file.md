I was trying to extract a single line from a [Duplicati](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/Duplicati.md) log to show on a monitor dash. Here is the shell script and example text log I was trying to read

`readfile.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the file name : " file
read -p "Enter the string to search for in the file : " str

grep "^$str" $file | { grep -v grep || true; }
```

`backup.log`
```txt
