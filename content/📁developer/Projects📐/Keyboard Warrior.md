[wchorski/keyboard-warrior: typing style game that makes fun of social media comments section (github.com)](https://github.com/wchorski/keyboard-warrior)

My first crack at a typing game. This is a re-imagined version of of my Unity3d game [Flame Warrior (itch.io)](https://williamusic.itch.io/flame-warrior)

#todo 
- [x] quotecomment - dislike like buttons working
- [ ] get it working with `onClick` instead of `pointerUp / Down`
- [x] ==BUG== ActiveContent: Names and content get mixed up when playing the game for some reason
- [x] typing game stats logging
- [ ] redirect user to `/game` after login
- [x] outsmart players who just hit a key and back space continuously (something with word completion?)
- [ ] link to user's profile that filters comments made by single user
- [ ] when playing game on mobile, the autocorrect really messes with the stats
- [ ] have prompts & comments. Maybe any comment can also be a prompt?
	- [ ] game has to choose a prompt that `> 10` replies
