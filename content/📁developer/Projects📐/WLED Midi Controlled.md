so I'm a big fan of the [WLED](📁developer/Home%20Lab%20🏠/WLED.md) project.

## Steps of Build
- Figure out WLED API
- Build Web App to interface with API
- Link parameters of web app with MIDI controller / Midi from Ableton
- create specific WLED presets 
	- be able to tap tempo speed
	- be able to color mix
	- change presets
	- dial in preset transition lengths.
	- dry / wet for effect strength
	- target / untarget specific fixtures checkboxes
